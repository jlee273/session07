    <h1>Session 07</h1>

    <h3>The goal is to visually represent these ideas:

        1. Loading Bar: Progress over time towards a goal, with a start and end point that does not repeat once it finishes (hint: use animation-fill-mode: forwards; so your animation stays where it is when it finishes)
        
        2. Waiting Circle: The depiction of time elapsing infinitely with no apparent end state. (hint: use animation-iteration-count: infinite; so your animation repeats forever).</h3>
